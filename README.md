## Programmers
* A programmer puts two glasses on his bedside table before going to sleep. A full one, in case he gets thirsty, and an empty one, in case he doesn’t.
* A programmer is heading out to the grocery store when his wife tells him "get a gallon of milk, and if they have eggs, get a dozen." He returns with 13 gallons of milk.
* A programmer his heading out to the grocery store when his wife tells him "get a gallon of milk, and while you're there, get some eggs too."  He never came home.
* A manager, a mechanical engineer, an IT guy, and software analyst are driving back from convention through the mountains. Suddenly, as they crest a hill, the brakes on the car go out and they fly careening down the mountain. After scraping against numerous guardrails, they come to a stop in the ditch. Everyone gets out of the car to assess the damage.

  The manager says, "Let's form a group to collaborate ideas on how we can solve this issue."

  The mechanical engineer suggests, "We should disassemble the car and analyze each part for failure."

  The IT guy says, "First we should all try getting out of the car, shutting all the doors, then getting back in again."

  The software analyst says, "Let's push it back up the hill and see if it does it again."
* How many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb? No can do. It's a hardware problem.
* A programmer is told to "go to hell". He finds the worst part of that statement is the "go to".
* Why do programmers confuse halloween and christmas? Because Oct 31 = Dec 25.
* Why don't programmers tell jokes in octal? Because 7 10 11!
* A biologist, a statistician, a mathematician and a computer scientist are on a photo-safari in Africa. They drive out into the savannah in their jeep, stop and scour the horizon with their binoculars.

  The biologist: "Look! There's a herd of zebras! And there, in the middle: a white zebra! It's fantastic! There are white zebras! We'll be famous!"

  The statistician: "It's not significant. We only know there's one white zebra"

  The mathematician: "Actually, we know there exists a zebra which is white on one side"

  The computer scientist: "Oh no! A special case!"
* A physician, a civil engineer, and a computer scientist were arguing about what was the oldest profession in the world. The physician remarked, "Well, in the Bible, it says that God created Eve from a rib taken out of Adam. This clearly required surgery, and so I can rightly claim that mine is the oldest profession in the world."

  The civil engineer interrupted, and said, "But even earlier in the book of Genesis, it states that God created the order of the heavens and the earth from out of the chaos. This was the first and certainly the most spectacular application of civil engineering. Therefore, fair doctor, you are wrong: mine is the oldest profession in the world."

  The computer scientist leaned back in her chair, smiled, and then said confidently, "Ah, but who do you think created the chaos?"
* Why do programmers take so long in the shower?

  They read the directions on the shampoo bottle and follow them to the letter:

  Lather, rinse, and repeat.
* "A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power off and on.

  Knight, seeing what the student was doing, spoke sternly: “You cannot fix a machine by just power-cycling it with no understanding of what is going wrong.”

  Knight turned the machine off and on.

  The machine worked."
* What do you call a developer that doesn't comment code?

  A developer.
* At a recent computer software engineering management course, the participants were given an awkward question to answer:

  "If you had just boarded an airliner and discovered that your team of programmers had been responsible for the flight control software, how many of you would disembark immediately?"

  Among the ensuing forest of raised hands only one man sat motionless. When asked what he would do, he replied that he would be quite content to stay aboard. With his team's software, he said, the plane was unlikely to even taxi as far as the runway, let alone take off.
* The programmer quit his job because he didn't get arrays.
* A computer programmer crosses a road when a frog calls out to him, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess."

  He bends over, picks up the frog and puts it in his pocket. The frog speaks up again and says, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one month."

  The computer programmer takes the frog out of his pocket, smiles at it and returns it to the pocket.

  The frog then cries out, "If you kiss me and turn me back, I'll do whatever you say!"

  Again the computer programmer takes the frog out, smiles at it and puts it back into his pocket.

  Finally, the frog asks, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a beautiful princess, I'll stay with you for a month and do whatever you say. What more do you want?"

  The computer programmer says, "Look, I'm an computer programmer . I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a talking frog, now that's cool!"
* Three programmers walk into a bar. The bartender asks them if they all would like a beer.

  I don't know, the first programmer replies.

  A stack overflow.
* If a programmer is up at 9 AM, it means he stayed up all night debugging his code.
* A doctor, a lawyer and an engineer are about to be put to death by guillotine. The doctor lays down, the executioner pulls the cord, and the blade sticks. The king decides that God has spared his life and so he lets him go free. The lawyer lays down, the executioner pulls the cord, and once again the blade sticks. The king sees this and releases him as well. The engineer lays down, looks up and says "I think I see your problem right here."

  Man: But I thought we were in the same class.

  Smiling, the programmer replies, "Yes."
* Why did the two functions stop calling each other?

  Because they had constant arguments.
* Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning.

## Management
* A man flying in a hot air balloon suddenly realizes he’s lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon further and shouts to get directions, "Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?"

  The man below says: "Yes. You're in a hot air balloon, hovering 30 feet above this field."

  "You must work in Information Technology," says the balloonist.

  "I do" replies the man. "How did you know?"

  "Well," says the balloonist, "everything you have told me is technically correct, but It's of no use to anyone."

  The man below replies, "You must work in management."

  "I do," replies the balloonist, "But how'd you know?"*

  "Well", says the man, "you don’t know where you are or where you’re going, but you expect me to be able to help. You’re in the same position you were before we met, but now it’s my fault."
* What did the Project Manager say to the Programmer?

  You start coding, I'll go find out what they want.
* A man walks into a pet shop and sees 3 monkeys, each in a cage, each with a computer. The man is curious and walks up to the clerk and asks - what is the story with the monkeys?

  "They are programming monkeys - for example this one here can complete 100 lines of C++ in an hour - only 100 dollars!"

  The first monkey was busy typing away, and sure enough it was flawless code.  They moved onto the second monkey who was typing even faster.

  "This monkey knows Java, C++ and helped develop Julia - 1000 dollars for this one."

  "What about that last monkey in the biggest cage?" the man asked.

  "Well he is 10,000 dollars..."

  "That must be an amazing monkey! What does he do?"

  "Well, when he was brought in all he did was sit there while the other monkeys worked, so we figured he must be executive management."
